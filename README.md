## Building a Simple Calculator App
Objective: Utilize the knowledge acquired during the initial two weeks to develop a
fundamental calculator application using Flutter. This task aims to assess your grasp of Dart
programming, widget composition, and fundamental user engagement with the core
principles.

Requirements:

• Implement a UI with number buttons (0-9), arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), and a
display area.

• Allow users to enter numbers by tapping buttons.

• Enable basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division.

• Display the calculated result in the display area.

• The app should be able to handle simple calculations with two operands and one
operator.
